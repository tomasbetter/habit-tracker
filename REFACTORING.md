# DayView.vue Component-Based Refactoring

## Overview

The original `DayView.vue` file was a monolithic component with 688 lines that violated the Single Responsibility Principle. This refactoring breaks it down into smaller, focused components and composables following Vue 3 best practices.

## Before vs After

### Before (Original DayView.vue)
- **688 lines** in a single file
- Mixed concerns: navigation, habit management, data persistence, UI rendering
- Hard to test and maintain
- Poor reusability
- Violated Single Responsibility Principle

### After (Refactored Architecture)
- **~100 lines** in DayView.vue (main orchestrator)
- **4 focused components** with single responsibilities
- **1 composable** for data management
- Clear separation of concerns
- Highly reusable and testable

## New Component Architecture

### 1. DayNavigation.vue
**Responsibility**: Date navigation and calendar controls
- Month navigation (previous/next)
- Week navigation (7-day view)
- Quick navigation (Today, Week forward/backward)
- Current date display

**Props**:
- `currentDate` (Date) - The currently selected date

**Features**:
- Self-contained navigation logic
- Router integration
- Responsive design
- Reusable across different views

### 2. HabitItem.vue
**Responsibility**: Individual habit display and interaction
- Checkbox for completion status
- Habit name display
- Action menu integration
- Future date handling

**Props**:
- `habit` (Object) - Habit data
- `isCompleted` (Boolean) - Completion status
- `isFutureDate` (Boolean) - Whether current date is in future
- `showMenu` (Boolean) - Whether action menu is open

**Emits**:
- `toggle` - When habit completion is toggled
- `edit`, `stop`, `delete` - Action menu events
- `toggle-menu`, `close-menu` - Menu state management

### 3. HabitList.vue
**Responsibility**: List management and habit operations
- Renders list of HabitItem components
- Handles "Add Habit" button
- Manages menu state for individual habits
- Future date warning display

**Props**:
- `habits` (Array) - List of habits to display
- `completedHabits` (Array) - List of completed habit IDs
- `isFutureDate` (Boolean) - Whether current date is in future

**Emits**:
- `add-habit` - When add habit button is clicked
- `edit-habit`, `stop-habit`, `delete-habit` - Habit management events
- `toggle-habit` - When habit completion is toggled

### 4. useHabitStore.js (Composable)
**Responsibility**: Data management and persistence
- Habit data loading/saving
- LocalStorage operations
- Habit CRUD operations
- Date formatting utilities

**Returns**:
- Reactive state: `habits`, `userHabits`, `defaultHabits`, `allHabits`
- Utility functions: `normalizeDate`, `formatDateKey`, etc.
- CRUD operations: `addHabit`, `updateHabit`, `stopHabit`, `deleteHabit`
- Data operations: `toggleHabit`, `getCompletedHabits`, `refreshHabits`

## Refactored DayView.vue

The main view is now a clean orchestrator that:
- Uses the `useHabitStore` composable for data management
- Renders `DayNavigation` for date controls
- Renders `HabitList` for habit management
- Handles modal state for add/edit operations
- Manages route changes and data refresh

## Benefits of This Architecture

### 1. **Single Responsibility Principle**
Each component has one clear purpose:
- DayNavigation: Date navigation
- HabitItem: Individual habit display
- HabitList: List management
- useHabitStore: Data management

### 2. **Reusability**
- Components can be reused in other views
- Composable can be shared across the application
- Navigation logic is independent of habit management

### 3. **Testability**
- Each component can be tested in isolation
- Composable logic can be unit tested
- Clear interfaces make mocking easier

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Smaller files are easier to understand
- Changes are isolated to specific components
- Clear separation of concerns

### 5. **Performance**
- Components can be optimized individually
- Better tree-shaking opportunities
- Reduced re-renders through proper prop design

## Migration Guide

### For Developers
1. **Import new components** in your views
2. **Use the composable** for habit data operations
3. **Follow the prop/emit pattern** for component communication
4. **Test components individually** rather than as a whole

### For Future Features
1. **Add new components** for new UI elements
2. **Extend the composable** for new data operations
3. **Keep components focused** on single responsibilities
4. **Use TypeScript interfaces** for better type safety

## Best Practices Applied

1. **Composition API**: Using `<script setup>` for cleaner code
2. **Props/Emits**: Clear component interfaces
3. **Composables**: Reusable business logic
4. **Scoped Styles**: Component-specific styling
5. **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach maintained
6. **Accessibility**: Touch targets and keyboard navigation preserved

This refactoring transforms a monolithic component into a maintainable, scalable, and testable component-based architecture while preserving all existing functionality.
